# Pixformer
Pixformer is a platform game inspired by Super Mario,
where you have to accumulate points by killing enemies
and grabbing coins in order to reach the end of the level.

This project was made for the Object Oriented Programming
course of the Computer Science and Engineering department of UniBo,
